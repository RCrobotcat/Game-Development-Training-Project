Oh, look whoâ€™s here!
A wizard like you, trapped in a place like this, hahaha...
What an amusing sight. Weren't you so formidable before?
 How did you end up in such a predicament?
Welcome to the dungeon, my friend.
This is a place unlike anything you've ever seen.
 You think your magic can help you escape?
 Here, all magic is nullified, except for the magic of setting up tower defenses.
Hahaha, you can only rely on your wits, courage, and not-so-nimble reflexes.
 If you want to get out, you must face numerous challenges.
It won't be easy; every level here is more dangerous and tricky than you can imagine.
 You'll encounter cunning traps, fierce monsters,
and some eerie beings you've never seen before.
Every step is a test, every moment filled with challenges.
But don't expect anyone to come to your rescue; it's all up to you.
Can you do it?
Or will you be stuck here forever, becoming part of this dungeon?
Let's wait and see.
